    <li> href value="https://google.com", id value = "the-best-link", class value = "banana", target value = "_blank"</li>
    <li> href is the hyperlink, its value is google.com. it has an id of "the-best-link" which you can use to apply CSS rules to (will ONLY apply to this element). it has the class "banana", so any CSS you give to the class "banana" will apply to
      this element (unless it is overwritten by something in "the-best-link"). target = "_blank" means the target link will open in a blank window.</li>
